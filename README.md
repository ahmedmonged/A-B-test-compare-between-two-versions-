# A/B test(Perform And Analysie Results)

### Introduction to the project
In this project, our goal is to perform an A/B test to determine if a new version of a website page outperforms an old version. To achieve this, we conduct an experiment where we collect data on visitor behavior from both pages. We then analyze the data using an A/B test to determine if there is a statistically significant improvement. By applying practical statistics, we can make an informed decision on whether the new version should be implemented or not.

### what is an A/B test?
An A/B test, also known as a split test, is a statistical experiment used to compare two different versions of a webpage, email, or any other marketing asset. The goal of an A/B test is to determine which version performs better in terms of a specific metric, such as click-through rate, conversion rate, or revenue.

This allows you to make data-driven decisions and optimize your marketing assets for improved performance.

A/B testing is widely used in various industries, including e-commerce, digital marketing, and web development, to continuously improve user experiences and drive better business outcomes.
