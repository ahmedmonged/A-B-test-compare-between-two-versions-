# A/B test(Perform And Analysie Results)

### Introduction to the project
In this project, our goal is to determine if a new version of a website page outperforms an old version. To achieve this, we conduct an experiment where we collect data on visitor behavior from both pages. We then analyze the data using an A/B test to determine if there is a statistically significant improvement. By applying practical statistics, we can make an informed decision on whether the new version should be implemented or not.

### what is an A/B test?
An A/B test, also known as a split test, is a statistical experiment used to compare two different versions of a webpage, email, or any other marketing asset. The goal of an A/B test is to determine which version performs better in terms of a specific metric, such as click-through rate, conversion rate, or revenue.

In an A/B test, two versions, A and B, are created, with only one element being different between them. This element could be the color of a button, the placement of a headline, or even the entire design of the page. The two versions are then randomly shown to different groups of users, and their interactions and behaviors are measured and analyzed.

By comparing the performance of version A with version B, you can determine which version leads to better results. This allows you to make data-driven decisions and optimize your marketing assets for improved performance.

A/B testing is widely used in various industries, including e-commerce, digital marketing, and web development, to continuously improve user experiences and drive better business outcomes.
